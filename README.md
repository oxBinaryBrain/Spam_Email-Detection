# Spam Email Detection using scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to build a simple spam email detection system using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

## Overview

The project uses a Bag-of-Words model and the Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam. It includes the following components:

1. Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
2. Preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets.
3. Vectorizing the emails using the Bag-of-Words representation.
4. Training a Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.
5. Evaluating the model's accuracy on the testing data.
6. Making predictions on new emails.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
